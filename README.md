### Points covered

1. The project is written in TypeScript.

3. The data is not called all at once; instead, movies data is added as the user scrolls using the Browser Observer API.
4. A genre filter has been added.
5. A search box has been added to search by movie name, actors' names, and director's name.
6. An overview of the movie is displayed on the backside of the card as you hover over it.
